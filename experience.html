                    The Ourisman Automotive Group was established back in the 1920's and has grown to be one of the largest auto dealers in the country today.

                    I’ve had the pleasure of beginning my career at this company in 2019 as an Internal Service Advisor at one of Ourisman’s Kia dealerships. In this position, I coordinate all internal repairs within the dealership for both used and new cars in our inventory. With over 300 cars in our inventory, there’s always a high demand for repair and maintenance orders. Writing up various service tickets and dispatching the work to technicians is one of my many responsibilities as an Internal Service Advisor. I establish and maintain a good rapport with the many vendors that collaborate with our dealership. Working closely with the sales team, I oversee which repair orders or appearance packages are to be approved by the general manager. As I follow up with customers and update them on the status of their cars, I ensure that they are satisfied with the final outcome of their purchase.

                    From 2017 to 2019, I greatly appreciated my time as a barista and team leader at Starbucks. I trained incoming employees on the daily operations at our store. I coordinated floor positions to other team members as we would rotate from taking orders, restocking, and making drinks. Providing outstanding service and crafting drinks accordingly to the specifications of our customers was a responsibility I took pride in. Including my career development prior to Starbucks, I have over five years of experience with customer service.
