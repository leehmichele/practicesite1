<p>Aside from work and school, I dabble in playing guitar to further my passion for music. </p>

<p>From 2017-2018, I’ve had the privilege of playing lead guitar for a tribute band called Los Sadicos. We covered songs by a Peruvian rock band from the 60’s and performed in several small venues such as Chapala Blue Beetle Rock Bar, Bossa Lounge, and Marx Café.</p>

    <p>In 2019, I also had the pleasure of filling in for a band called Plastic Nancy as Sam and Brian couldn’t make it to the performance at Slash Run. I was given the opportunity by my good friend Mikey who is a member of the band. Although Matt (the drummer who filled in) and I had learned the set two hours before the show, it was a fun and successful performance nonetheless.</p>

    <p>It was inspiring to play with and learn from such talented musicians. From left to right: Brian (drummer), Sam (lead vocals and guitar), John (lead and rhythm guitar), and Mikey (bassist). Plastic Nancy's lastest album "Last of the Electric Flowers" is available on both Apple Music and Spotify.</p>
